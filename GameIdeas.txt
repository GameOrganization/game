List game ideas here:
1. top down turn based strategy game with synchronized actions
	-similar to xcom, but you give each unit orders every turn and they all execute simultaneously as opposed to one at a time
2. legends of grimrock style first person puzzle/adventure
3. roguelike rpg puzzle-y first person, could have similar elements to grimrock
	-random dungeons are created with certain puzzles built in that must be solved before progression
	-random loot found in chests, loot and xp from enemies, could add more things like shops and smiths etc
4. hex grid version of ice puzzle
	-this could be made for mobile phones or something
	-could be rendered in 3d for the e-peen
5. sidescroller physics puzzle game
	-this sounds fun to me, but i have basically no experience with collision detection and whatnot
